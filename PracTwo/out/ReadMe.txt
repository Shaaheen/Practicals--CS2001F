To Run: Use "make" from terminal in root folder PracTwo. Then use java TreeUI as that is the main Driver class. Use "make clean" and load up new Task.
	Currently Task 1 is in use

Main Java files kept in PracTwoSource 

Every Task is kept in a zip file in their respective folders
Extract Task into PracTwo and replace old files to access desired Task

Evidence files are also in main folder 
There is testing for each Task which is kept in their zip files in a test folder inside PracTwoSource
Testing uses the evidence cases provided as proof that program works with them

Thanks for your time
